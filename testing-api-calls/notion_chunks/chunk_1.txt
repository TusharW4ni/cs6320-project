Suggest Edits Utilizing Notion's Public API for Integrations A Notion workspace is a collaborative environment where teams can organize work, manage projects, and store information in a highly customizable way. Notion's REST API facilitates direct interactions with workspace elements through programming. Key functionalities include: Pages : Create, update, and retrieve page content. Databases : Manage database, properties, entries, and schemas. Users : Access user profiles and permissions. Comments : Handle page and inline comments. Content Queries : Search through workspace content. Authentication : Secure integrations with OAuth 2.0. Link Previews : Customize how links appear when shared. To make interactions within Notion workspaces programmatically, you must associate these actions with a Notion user. Notion facilitates this by allowing API requests to be linked to a "bot" user. Developers create integrations to define a bot's capabilities, including authenticating API requests, deciding when to make requests, and setting the bot's read/write permissions. Essentially, using Notion's Public API involves creating an integration that outlines how a bot interacts with your workspace and assigns REST API requests to the bot. There are two primary integration types: Internal : For private workspace enhancements. Public : For broader, shareable functionalities, including Link Previews . For further details on integration possibilities and API specifics, proceed with the guide or consult the API reference . Check out our demos for practical examples. What is a Notion Integration? A Notion integration, sometimes referred as a connection , enables developers to programmatically interact with Notion workspaces. These integrations facilitate linking Notion workspace data with other applications or the automation of workflows within Notion. Integrations are installed in Notion workspaces and require explicit permission from users to access Notion pages and databases. Create Notion integrations that unlock new possibilities for teams. Notion users have access to a vast library of existing integrations to enrich their experience further. For developers interested in creating custom solutions, Notion supports the development of both internal and public integrations. Both utilize the Notion API for workspace interactions. Let's explore internal and public integrations. Internal vs. Public Integrations Notion integrations come in two types: Internal and Public. Understanding the differences between them helps in choosing the right approach for your development needs. Internal Integrations are exclusive to a single workspace, accessible only to its members. They are ideal for custom workspace enhancements. Public Integrations are designed for a wider audience, usable across any Notion workspace. They cater to broad use cases and follow the OAuth 2.0 protocol for workspace access.
