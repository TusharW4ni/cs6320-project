Create comment
POST
https://api.notion.com/v1/comments

Creates a comment in a page or existing discussion thread.

Returns a comment object for the created comment.

There are two locations where a new comment can be added with the public API:

A page.
An existing discussion thread.

The request body will differ slightly depending on which type of comment is being added with this endpoint.

To add a new comment to a page, aÂ parentÂ object with a page_id must be provided in the body params.

To add a new comment to an existing discussion thread, aÂ discussion_idÂ string must be provided in the body params. (Inline comments to start a new discussion thread cannot be created via the public API.)

Either the parent.page_id or discussion_id parameter must be provided â€” not both.

To see additional examples of creating a page or discussion comment and to learn more about comments in Notion, see the Working with comments guide.

Errors

Each Public API endpoint can return several possible error codes. See the Error codes section of the Status codes documentation for more information.
